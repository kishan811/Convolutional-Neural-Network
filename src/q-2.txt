Q 2.

1. Number of parameters in 1st convolution layer = ( Height * Width + Bias ) * No.of Channels = (5 * 5 * 1 + 1) * 6 = 156

2. Number of parameters in pooling operation = 0

3. No. of parameters in following:- 
a) Conv 1 = 156 
    Conv 2 = (5 * 5 * 6 + 1) * 16 = 2416
b) Pool = 0 
c) Fully connected layer (FC) = (84 + 1) * 120 = 10,200 
d) Activation Functions = 84 
    So, Fully connected layer contains most number of parameters.
    
4. Fully connected layers at the end consume most amount of memory as their weight and activations matrix is more complex than convolutional layers feature map matrix.
